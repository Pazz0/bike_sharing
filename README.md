## Summary

The analysis reveals several key insights into the bike-sharing patterns of users. For instance, we can observe differences in trip duration, peak hours, and preferred days of the week based on user type and gender. We would condsider promotions for Wednesday Afternoon as well as focusing advertising for Females. These visualizations can help inform the development of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

### For future outlooks, two additional visualizations are suggested:

We suggest Analyzing the relationship between trip distance and duration to understand how far users typically travel on their bike trips.
We would also Investigate the impact of weather conditions on bike-sharing usage to plan for potential challenges and adjustments during extreme weather events.
By incorporating these findings and insights into the bike-sharing program proposal, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to optimize the program's success in Des Moines. Understanding New Yorker preferences and their patterns can help tailor marketing efforts, improve bike distribution, and adjust pricing structures to attract and retain users for many years. Ultimately, this data-driven approach will contribute to the development of a robust and successful bike-sharing program that meets the needs of both our users and investors.
