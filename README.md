### For future outlooks, two additional visualizations are suggested:

Analyze the relationship between trip distance and duration to understand how far users typically travel on their bike trips.
Investigate the impact of weather conditions on bike-sharing usage to plan for potential challenges and adjustments during extreme weather events.
By incorporating these findings and insights into the bike-sharing program proposal, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to optimize the program's success in Des Moines. Understanding user preferences and patterns can help tailor marketing efforts, improve bike distribution, and adjust pricing structures to attract and retain users effectively. Ultimately, this data-driven approach will contribute to the development of a robust and successful bike-sharing program that meets the needs of both users and investors.
